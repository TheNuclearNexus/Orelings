**Orelings** is a minecraft datapack which introduces naturaly spawning mobs to your minecraft world.

These Orelings will produce their coresponding materials on a regular basis.

However, they must be kept happy, well fed, and well hydrated otherwise they'll perish.
The player must keep active care of them in order to maximize the amount of resources.

## Spawning
Orelings will naturally spawn in caves of the overworld and the surface of the nether.
Naturally spawned orelings will despawn after 5 minutes or if there is no player nearby so be sure to find them quickly.

## Transporting
Orelings can be picked up in bundles in order to move them around easily.
While in a bundle, their stats will not progress but resources will not produced either.
Naming the bundle will apply the name to the Oreling, named Orelings will show a message in chat if they die.

## Stats

### Happiness
Orelings are social creatures, loneliness will decrease their happiness quite quickly.
However, be careful of how many friends are nearby, too many may have the same effect.

Certain orelings may like other varieties more or less, so experiment with different combinations

### Hunger
Overtime your orelings will lose hunger, right clicking them with most vegetables or cooked foods will replinsh some amount. Each Oreling has it's own favorite food type; when fed it it'll restore 7% hunger and 2% happiness.

### Thrist
Similiar to hunger, thirst will deplete overtime, use water bottles to keep them well hydrated.

## Merging
When 2 of the same Orelings are at 90% or higher happiness, they'll have a chance to merge into one large Oreling. Big Orelings drop 3-5 of their resource instead of 1-2. They aren't free though, big orelings will lose hunger at ~2x the rate.
